# CS 350 Module 8 Journal

**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**

The project's main goal is to create a thermostat system that helps control room temperature. It addresses the problem of maintaining the right temperature in a room. Users can change the desired temperature by pressing buttons. The system will then adjust the temperature by 1 degree every 200 milliseconds, either making it warmer or cooler. There's also a light (LED) that works like a heater. If the room gets too warm, the light turns off, and if it gets too cold, the light turns on. Moreover, the system can mimic changes in room temperature, for example, by responding to the warmth of a person's finger placed on a temperature sensor.

**What did you do particularly well?**

In this project, I successfully set up and managed various components of the thermostat system, like the buttons, LED, temperature sensor, and communication. I also handled errors effectively, ensuring the system operates smoothly.

**Where could you improve?**

To make this project even better, I could add more explanations in the code to make it easier for others to understand. Additionally, I could enhance error messages for better troubleshooting.

**What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?**

For future projects, I'll continue to rely on helpful resources like development boards, sensor datasheets, and online communities or experts who can provide guidance and solutions.

**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?**

The skills I've developed in setting up and managing hardware components, handling interrupts, and debugging code will be valuable for future projects, especially those involving embedded systems.

**How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

To ensure the project remains easy to maintain and adapt, I structured the code logically with clear function names and used descriptive variable names. This organization makes it simple to modify specific parts of the code without affecting the whole system.
